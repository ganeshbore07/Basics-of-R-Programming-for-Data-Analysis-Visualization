# Basics-of-R-Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Visualization

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

Advantages of R-
1. It’s open-source. No fees or licenses are needed.
2. It’s platform-independent. R runs on all operating systems, so developers only need to create one program that can work on competing systems.
3. It has lots of packages. For example, the R language has more than 10,000 packages stored in the CRAN repository.
4. It’s great for statistics. Statistics are a big thing today, and R shines in this regard. As a result, programmers prefer it over other languages for statistical tool development.
5. It’s well suited for Machine Learning. R is ideal for machine learning operations such as regression and classification
